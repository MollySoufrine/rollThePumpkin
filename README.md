# rollThePumpkin

For this activity i followed instructions from a udemy course about javascript.

The idea of the game was to have two players roll dice and who ever rolls enough to add up to the final score wins. The players can select the final score or the default is 100. If a player rolls a 1 it changes their score to 0. If a player also rolls two 6's in a row it should change their score to 0 also.

When players input their final score to play until, they must press hold for it to stay and for the game to register the #. They can also change it throughout the game. What ive noticed is when you select new game during a game, if re starts the game. However once you win, you must refresh the page. The select new gam button doesnt seem to work once someone has won. I will look into this more.

To put my own spin on this, I first started out changing the background, fonts and icons to orange and black to resemble halloween. I originally changed the dice to pumpkins too. The more comfortable i felt, I decided to change the photos to some of Nightmare Before Christmas. I used a few quotes from the movie as well. For example when someone rolls it says "nice work, bone daddy" which is what someone says to jack skellington in the movie.

I also changed the "roll dice" to "Dare to roll?"

As time goes on i may add some more to the game or change it.
